## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for both Swift and Objective-C. ScrollableStackView is available through CocoaPods. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

#### Podfile

To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'

target 'TargetName' do
    pod "ScrollableStackView"
end
```
Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

#### Test Drive | Try Now ðŸš€

You can try library before you add it to your project ðŸŽ¯ Give it a try:    

```bash
$ pod try ScrollableStackView
```

Pod try is a wonderful subcommand which allows you to quickly launch the demo project of a Pod. It can be used to assess the quality of a library â€“ very useful for user interface elements â€“ or to quickly get up to speed on how to use it.

## Usage
### Sample Code (Swift)

```swift
import ScrollableStackView

var scrollable = ScrollableStackView(frame: view.frame)
view.addSubview(scrollable)

// add your views with
let rectangle = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 55))
rectangle.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue
scrollable.stackView.addArrangedSubview(rectangle)
// ...

// you can set margins directly on the stackview
scrollable.stackView.layoutMargins = UIEdgeInsets(top: 8, left: 8, bottom: 8, right: 8)
scrollable.stackView.isLayoutMarginsRelativeArrangement = true

```

### Sample Code (Objective-C)

```objective-c
@import ScrollableStackView

ScrollableStackView *scrollable = [[ScrollableStackView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.frame];
scrollable.stackView.distribution = UIStackViewDistributionFillProportionally;
scrollable.stackView.alignment = UIStackViewAlignmentCenter;
scrollable.stackView.axis = UILayoutConstraintAxisVertical;
[self.view addSubview:scrollable];

UIView *rectangle = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 55)];
[rectangle setBackgroundColor:[UIColor blueColor]];

// add your views with
[scrollable.stackView addArrangedSubview:rectangle];
// ...
```
